# Northcoders News API

# # Required Setup

A test and development environment variable need to be setup for connection to local databases.

To do this create two files .env.test and .env.development. Set key **PGDATABASE** to be nc_news_test and nc_news respectively.

```
.env.test
PGDATABASE=nc_news_test
```
